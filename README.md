  Diogo was fantastic and went above and beyond my expectations. He worked until all hours of the night getting a mission-critical project finished and anticipated possible challenges. I'm ready to hire him for my next project!

  In addition to the original scope of the project, there were many additional tasks and we managed to accomplish a lot. Communication was at the highest level. Even when we encountered obstacles, finding a common solution was not a problem. I am sure that after this project we both had some valuable takeaways. Great job!
