Diogo was fantastic and went above and beyond my expectations. He worked until all hours of the night getting a mission-critical project finished and anticipated possible challenges. I'm ready to hire him for my next project!

**Fix Issues after creating Ajax user profile (Ultimate Member - User Profile & Membership Plugin)** *24 Aug 2021*
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

In addition to the original scope of the project, there were many additional tasks and we managed to accomplish a lot. Communication was at the highest level. Even when we encountered obstacles, finding a common solution was not a problem. I am sure that after this project we both had some valuable takeaways. Great job!
